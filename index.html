  <p>My hobby is biking because everyday, if I am not busy, I get on my bike and ride with my friends. I just made some new ones, but I have to keep my distance. So I can stay safe and have fun. Anyways, me and my friends talk about our lives and tell SOME of our secrets. We laugh, we talk, we bike, and then we go home. I always take a nice, hot shower after every bike ride. Biking is the only thing I do every single day.
